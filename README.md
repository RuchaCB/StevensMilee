# StevensMilee
The goal of this project is to develop a social networking website that will be specifically for the Stevens community’s internal use. During these times of pandemic, it’s difficult for people to collaborate. As such, no social networking website exists which is internal to Stevens. This project when developed successfully, will not only help people in collaborating but it will also solve a lot of problems that students face related to academics or in general. Some features which our team has planned to implement are:
  Developing a feature using which students can create their own profiles  
  Developing a Newsfeed where a student can post on his/her timeline 
  Developing the ‘Add StevensDuck’ functionality, through which Stevens students can add friends 
  Implementing the search feature where ducks can look out for each other and events 
  Developing messaging functionality so that students can interact 
  Adding a ‘Read message’ feature, which will show the user whether the  message he sent is read or not 
  Adding ‘Upload Photo’ and ‘Add Status’ functionality 
  Adding functionality to like and comment on a post 
  Adding a Stevens Meet-up   
Tech Stack to be used: Java-based Spring Boot Framework, MySQL for database operations, Bootstrap for developing the User Interface, JavaScript for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
